## üóÉÔ∏è Data Sources & Modeling

This project integrates and transforms data from multiple sources to create a unified view of business operations.

### Data Sources:

1.  **Sales data:** Excel workbook (`Tailwind Traders Sales.xlsx`, `Tailwind Traders Sales(Cleaned).xlsx`).
2.  **Purchases data:** Excel workbook (`Purchases.xlsx`).
3.  **Countries data:** Excel workbook (`Countries.xlsx`).
4.  **Currency Exchange data:** Python script for dynamic exchange rates.

### Data Preparation (ETL with Power Query):

  * **Sales Data Preparation:** Calculated key financial metrics directly within Power Query or as calculated columns:
      * `Gross Revenue` (calculated from Quantity and Price).
      * `Total Tax` (calculated from Tax Rate and Gross Revenue).
      * `Net Revenue` (calculated from Gross Revenue and Total Tax).
  * **Data Loading & Transformation:** All four data sources were loaded into Power BI. Extensive Power Query transformations were applied to:
      * Optimize data types.
      * Validate data quality.
      * Clean and standardize data.

### Data Model Design:

  * A **star schema** was implemented as the foundation of the data model, optimizing for performance and analytical flexibility.
  * **Relationships:** Established clear relationships between tables:
      * `Countries` ‚Üî `Exchange Data` (1:1).
      * `Sales` ‚Üî `Countries` (\*:1).
      * `Purchases` ‚Üî `Sales` (1:1).
  * **Calculated Tables (DAX):**
      * **Calendar Table:** A dedicated date dimension table created using DAX to support time intelligence calculations.
      * **Sales in USD Table:** A calculated table to convert sales figures into a standardized USD currency using exchange rates.

      * **Best Sales Region:** The **UAE** demonstrates the highest median sales ($680.79), highlighting a high-value market for increased investment.
      * **Profitability by Region:** The **UK** shows the highest loyalty points (315), suggesting a strong customer base and potential for targeted retention strategies.
      * *Visualizations:* Median Sales Distribution (Pie Chart), Yearly Profit Margin by Country (Donut Chart), Loyalty Points by Country (Bar Chart).

  * **Sales Trends & Forecasting:**

      * **Median Sales Over Time:** A clear line chart with forecasting capabilities helps identify seasonal trends and predict future sales performance.
      * *Visualizations:* Median Sales Over Time (Line Chart with forecast).

  * **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

      * **Overall Financial Health:** At-a-glance KPI cards display critical metrics such as `Yearly Profit Margin`, `Quarterly Profit`, `YTD Profit`, `Net Revenue (USD)`, and `Gross Revenue (USD)`.
      * *Visualizations:* Card visuals for KPIs.

## üß≠ Strategic Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive analysis and insights generated, the following strategic recommendations are proposed for Tailwind Traders:

### 1\. Product Portfolio Optimization

  * **Focus on High-Performing Products:** Prioritize inventory and marketing for the Modular Sofa Set (top net revenue generator) and similar high-margin products.
  * **Review Underperforming Items:** Investigate products with lowest net revenue (e.g., Floral Wallpaper at $9.60) for potential discontinuation or pricing strategy revision.
  * *Expected Impact:* Potential for an **18-22% increase in inventory turnover** by optimizing product mix.

### 2\. Customer Engagement & Loyalty

  * **Enhance Loyalty Programs:** Leverage the high loyalty observed in the UK (315 loyalty points) to develop targeted retention campaigns. Consider expanding successful loyalty tactics to other regions.
  * **Personalized Promotions:** Use sales rep performance data (e.g., individual transaction counts) to identify best practices for sales team training.

### 3\. Operational Efficiency

  * **Inventory Optimization:** Align stock levels with the quantity purchased patterns (average 2.8 units/transaction, max 6 units). This aims to reduce carrying costs by 12%.
  * **Warranty Strategy Review:** Adjust warranty offerings based on analysis (current average 18.88 months) to balance customer satisfaction and costs.
  * **Dynamic Pricing Model:** Implement a DAX-powered price elasticity analysis to inform dynamic pricing strategies, with a target for Phase 1 implementation within 3 months.

### 4\. Geographic Market Strategy

  * **Prioritize UAE Market Expansion:** Capitalize on UAE's highest median sales ($680.79) by increasing marketing investment and product availability in this region.
  * *Expected Impact:* Potential for a **5-8% increase in market share** in targeted regions.

### 5\. Reporting & Analytics Enhancements

  * **Advanced Time Intelligence:** Incorporate year-over-year comparison measures to track growth trends.
  * **Customer Segmentation:** Add customer demographic data to enable more sophisticated RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

### 6\. Technical Infrastructure Upgrades

  * **Migrate Data Sources:** Transition from Excel files to a cloud data warehouse (e.g., Azure SQL DB) for real-time updates.
  * **Automate Exchange Rates:** Replace the manual Python script for currency conversion with an automated Power Automate Flow for automated refreshes.
  * **Implement Advanced Power BI Features:**
      * Configure **data-driven alerts** for inventory thresholds and for Gross Revenue \< $400.
      * Implement **Row-Level Security (RLS)** for regional managers.
      * Develop **paginated reports** for operational data.
  * *Expected Impact:* **Increased efficiency by 30%** through automation and improved data infrastructure.
